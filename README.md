## Hi, my name is William Diaz Orozco
###Full Stack Web Developer

I’m 31 years old, I’m a Web Developer born in Valledupar, Cesar, Colombia, as a Web Dev I have the notions and knowledge to create efficiency and dynamics SPA using ReactJS for the job, I can work with redux as a complement to improve my work and other technologies like Node.JS, express, jest and others important libraries of React and JS also libraries and frameworks of CSS like Bootstrap, Less and others. 

Although I’m focused on frontend development, I’m in the capacity of make queries to a DB and make request to APIs and manipulate the data if it is necessary, besides, I’m available to handle versions of the SPA throw Git using the CMD, Git Bash or the IDE´s Terminal.

I have good foundations in SQL for create DB, I use Laragon and phpMyAdmin as interface for handle Relational Data Bases and GIT for the version management of each project. 

As a person I’m super enthusiasm, always eager to answer the best way possible, and most importantly honest when an answer is unknown, but continue to work on the question even when we have moved on.
