## Full Stack Web Developer

I’m a 31 years old Web Developer born in Valledupar, Cesar, Colombia. i love what the world of Javascript languages and HTML5 technologies can do to create amazing Web Applications

As a Web Dev my passion is to create efficiency and dynamics SPA using ReactJS for the job, I can work with redux as a complement to improve my work and other technologies like Node.JS, express, jest and others important libraries of React and JS also libraries and frameworks of CSS like Bootstrap, Less and others.

In march 2022 i become á student of Henry Academy to get certified my skills as a Full Stack Web Developer and the 2021 i got the certification for the same rol by the the Bolivarian Pontifical University in agreement with the Ministry of Telecommunications of the Colombian goverment.

My travel in tech begins in 2012 when i made a course of Web Design and discovere my skills to create amazing websites, since then i have been improving my skills follow important authors like Kyle Simpson, Tyler McGinnis, Samer Buna and Eric Elliot and reading literature as well:

-Eloquent Javascript
-Javascript Design Patterns
-You Don't Know JS
-Functional Light JS

Although I’m focused on frontend development, I’m in the capacity of make queries to a DB and make request to APIs and manipulate the data if it is necessary, besides, I’m available to handle versions of the SPA throw Git using the CMD, Git Bash or the IDE´s Terminal.

As a person I’m super enthusiasm, always eager to answer the best way possible, and most importantly honest when an answer is unknown, but continue to work on the question even when we have moved on.
